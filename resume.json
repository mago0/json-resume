He was the primary leader on the Site Reliability Team, leading numerous efforts at Tilt including: Infrastructure automation using Cloud Formation and Chef; Migration to Auto-Scaling for high reliability and scalability; Scalable system design support 20x increases in traffic for high load events. I consider Matt an expert at AWS, site reliability engineering, and linux systems. He is passionate about learning new things and is an incredibly hard worker. I believe he could help out almost any company trying to automate, scale, and manage their Cloud Infrastructure (and a lot more)."

    "name": "William Wolf, Director of Technology at Tilt.com",
    "reference": "I've had the pleasure to work with Matt pretty extensively, first at Rackspace early on in my career, and most recently at Tilt. I can truly say that Matt is an amazing person to work with, and one of the hardest working, most passionate people I've ever met. Matt is able to quickly ramp up on new technologies, and discern what's a fad from what will add true, lasting value to the problem at hand. He's able to mentor others (even remotely) while moving incredibly fast. He takes pride in his work, and is a stickler for details. I've watched Matt masterfully manage 100+ servers (bare metal!) all by himself, and migrate entire production infrastructures seamlessly from one cloud provider to another. You quickly learn that you can throw any new challenge Matt's way, and he will rise to, and even exceed expectations, learning whatever is necessary along the way. It's always a pleasure to work with Matt, and I look forward to continuing to learn from him in the future."

    "reference": "As a founding team-member at Tilt, Matt was immediately busy with building out our infrastructure from scratch (and scaling it through millions of users; always moving fast in the highly-regulated payments space). He is the type of team-member you really cherish working with because he was always 10-steps ahead, asking himself the questions that no one else would even consider asking for a few months (and usually having the right answer already implemented way before anyone asked!). Can’t stress it enough, he’s a brilliant, dynamic individual that cares about his craft, his team, and his customers to a rare extent that just continued to blow us away as we scaled Tilt globally."
